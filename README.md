# The LockerProblem is a project from Java Bootcamp

It simulates an experiement where there are 100 closed lockers. Start with the first locker and for every locker open it. Next start with the second locker, for this locker and every second one after that, if the locker is open, close it. And if the locker is closed, open it. Do this for the 3rd, 4th...nth iteration to 100. Print the list of open lockers and notice the pattern.
